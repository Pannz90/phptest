To whom may concern:

Greetins, my name is Jose! I graduated on Physiotherapy in 2011 and I've been working as such until the beginning of this year - where, because of health reasons, I decided to stop it and restart my childhood / teenage dream.

This dream was to study programming. I was always fascinated about all the information that was hidden behind the basic programs, webs and games I used to check daily. For a few months already I've been studying the basics of web developing. I started in codeacademy with their HTML / CSS / javascript courses; and then I moved into Ruby and RoR - which I honestly loved for the incredibly simple design.

After looking for job positions in MeetFrank that would help me develope my skills, I found yours - and even tho I never got to study PHP, I got intrigued by it and decided to give it a try!

Therefore I present you my response to your trial. I have to admit it took longer than I expected, and it is not as "on point" as I would have liked it to be. I know I have a lot to learn but I can assure you that has never been a problem to me! I'm a very dedicated person, and very passionate about the theme.

Lastly, and advancing a possible negative answer; I would like to request feedback from you. I am still in learning process and I can use any input you could give me on where to keep working on, strong and weak points...

tl;dr: Thank you for the opportunity, and I hope to hear from you soon!
